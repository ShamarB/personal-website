								<h2>My (short) Story</h2>
								<p>Where to start...how about the beginning. I am a military child and the second youngest of 4. I was a very active and busy child. Football, basketball, and track, so sports all year round! Summer camp just about every single summer. I learned how to play the trumpet, piano, guitar, ukulele, and a smidge of violin. And there was hardly ever a weekend where I didn't sleep over at a close friends house. I went to school in Maryland and decided to stay close to home and go to Towson University. I actually came to Towson as a Business Management major, but I never felt challanged in my coursework. I always felt a strong connection to science and math as a young kid and throughout high school. My parents never swayed me to go into tech but I knew how much they enjoyed working in it, and I felt as though I would have a good support system in my choice. So after my first semester I changed to <em>Computer Science</em>. I fell in love with it during my first class when my professor would talk to us in quite an ambitious tone about the power of coding and it was truly inspiring. Four years later, I have my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. Ready to take on the world! </p>
