									<p>Hi! My name is Shamar Billingslea and welcome to my personal website. Here you can watch my growth as a software engineer, business man, and a normal everyday person. I am a recent graduate of Towson University (GO TIGERS!). It was at Towson where I met some of my best friends and made connections that will last a lifetime. I was apart of many organizations on campus. The National Society of Black Engineers, Alpha Kappa Psi Business Fraternity, Black Student Union, and some smaller clubs here and there. There I majored in Computer Science. (no I don't know why your hp laptop is acting weird) And I completed an internship with my current employer, Northrop Grumman.</p>

										<p>Have you ever been in a class on the first day and the teacher says "okay everyone, today where going to get to know one another by doing icebreakers." It's the worst right? Like why must I stand up in front of the class and tell two truths and a lie about myself when you have absolutely zero context about me or my life. Like what a great way to start when you <em>just</em> read from the syllabus about integrity. Anyway...when people ask me to describe myself, I don't really know where to start. I mean this is a 400 level computer science program I would hope we <em>all</em> like to code. But I suppose the next thing that would come to mind is a fashionista. (There isn't a male version of that word, I looked it up) I love dressing up and putting together different outfits. My favorite type of fashion is streetwear. Designers like Virgil Abloh, Eric Emanuel, Warren Lotas create some of my favorite pieces. You can see more pictures of me on my instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shamizleee/" target="_blank">@shamizleee</a>.</p>
