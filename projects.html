								<h2>Mizle Bot 2.0</h2>
								<div class="twitter-box-content">
									<h3>Introduction</h3>
									<p>
										The Mizle Bot is a twitter application that I started developing during the COVID-19 pandemic. I was on social media and I wondered if I could collect all of the data from my profile, my followers, who I'm following, tweets that metioned a specific person or place, and said..."hey I bet I can code something to analyze these things". So I took a look at developer.twitter.com</a> and made my developer acount. I wanted to gain experience working with API's and creating my own applications.

									<h3>Functionalities</h3>

										Here are a few functionalities that I've developed so far...

									<div class="functionalities-list">
										<ul>
											<li>Automated Login with Selenium</li>
											<li>Basic Tweets from console</li>
											<li>Tweets at preset times</li>
											<li>Response to tweets with specified keywords</li>
											<li>Direct messaging capabilites with automated message</li>
											<li>Check who I follow but does not follow me back &#x1F92A;</li>

										<p>Here is an example of the twitter bots ability to find the most recent tweets and do something with them. Here I told the bot to find three tweets that mention "Black Lives Matter" and then like them.</p>

										<p>This is the login script I wrote with Selenium. I honestly have only good things to say about Selenium. Web automation makes everything so much easier and fun. The program automatically opens up Google Chrome and then searches for twitter. After that, the bot clicks login and enters the username and password credentials. Then boom, we're logged into our Twitter profile.</p>

								<h2>Supreme Bot</h2>
								<div class="supreme-box-content">
									<h3>Introduction</h3>
									<p>
										My Supreme Bot is a automated purchase bot, made to streamline and speed up the proccess of buying high in demand items. If you're like me and very much so into popular streetwear brands like Supreme, Eric Emanuel, Bape, etc. you know just how hard it is to cop items when they drop. Competeing with thousands of people around the world trying to get the same color and size as you. I was runnning into this problem all too often and decided I would do something about it. Then I made.... my very own Supreme Bot.

									<h3>Functionalities</h3>

										Here are a few functionalities that I've developed so far...

									<div class="functionalities-list">
										<ul>
											<li>Automated Select based off of predetermined position on page</li>
											<li>Utilizes HTML page properties to navigate and select based off of xPath</li>
											<li>Action automation done with Selenium</li>
											<li>Add to cart and checkout in a matter of seconds</li>
											<li>Information already entered into configuration file</li>
											<li>Cop all the sought after pieces and say goodbye to L's &#x1F60E;</li>

										<p>Here is a video of the supreme bot in action. It finishes in about 7 seconds depending on if I have run the bot previously. Truth be told I had the most fun working on this project because it combined two things I enjoy. Python and Supreme. Most of the time, if there was an item that was really sought after, it would end up selling out in seconds, long before you could even select the size and color you wanted. The streetwear markets are constantly littered with bots, so for someone like me who just wants to buy Supreme to wear it, I found myself constantly upset and out of luck. Then I decided instead of just losing out on clothes that I want, why not put my Computer Science degree to use and start competing with these bots. Thus the idea was born. I took some time to scour the internet with what I should use to automate the proccess and I came across a python library called <em>Selenium</em>. Then I started coding. After a few days I finished the bot. It worked like a charm and helped me cop items I probably wouldn't have gotten otherwise. I then took at making a bot for Eric Emanuel shorts. Another fashion designer whose clothes have gotten a little too popular. I finished that bot in about a days time.</p>
